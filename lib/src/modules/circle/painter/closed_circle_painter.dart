/// A [CustomPainter] that draws a closed oval (or circle, depending on text aspect ratio)
/// decoration around a given text.
///
/// This painter renders a single, continuous oval shape that encloses the text.
/// It extends [TextDecoratorPainter], taking text content, style, and a
/// [DecorationBase] object (which provides color and stroke width) to define
/// its appearance.
///
/// The sizing and positioning of the oval are calculated based on the dimensions
/// of the text (obtained via the [CircleConstraints] mixin using `getCircleSizes`)
/// and internal scaling factors and offsets to achieve a visually encompassing effect.
/// These scaling factors are currently hardcoded.
///
/// This painter asserts that the provided [text] is not empty and that
/// `decoration.strokeWidth` is greater than 0.
///
/// Example (conceptual, as direct usage might be part of a larger framework):
/// ```dart
/// CustomPaint(
///   painter: ClosedCirclePainter(
///     text: "Closed Circle Text",
///     textStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.black),
///     decoration: CircleDecoration(color: Colors.green, strokeWidth: 1.5), // Assuming CircleDecoration is compatible
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
